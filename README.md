# added to master branch
# This is a demo code.
# Project Aim:
The program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.

Make sure you have rust available and install along with rust.
